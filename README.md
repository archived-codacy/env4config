This is an alternative `config.strategy` for [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config) to enable Environment Variable substitution on every configuration key without the need to explicitly bind the substitution in the configuration file.

Please note that this library is published as a road unblocker until [this PR](https://github.com/lightbend/config/pull/620) find it's way upstream.

## Conventions

Each environment variable is transformed as follows:

 - remove the trailing prefix `config.env_var_prefix` ( Default: `CONFIG_`)
 - trasform all the `_` characters into `.`
 - trasform all the `__` characters into `-`
 - trasform all the `___` characters into `_`

## Usage

Import this library along with Typesafe Config:
```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.typesafe" % "config" % <typesafe-config-version>,
  "com.codacy" % "env4config" % <version>
)
```
Then specify the proper `config.strategy` as a Java property:
```
java -Dconfig.strategy=com.codacy.config.EnvFirstConfigLoadingStrategy <....>
```

## Rationale

According to the [Twelve-factor App](https://12factor.net/config) the configuration should be passed to the applications via environment variables.

The "de-facto" standard for configuration in Scala application is [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config) and env variables are a [supported fallback](https://github.com/lightbend/config#optional-system-or-env-variable-overrides); still it is not possible to override *virtually* any configuration of our application if not properly encoded the binding accordingly.

Although [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config#overview) offers an hook as a `config.strategy` to tune the initial loading order of configurations, leveraging it is possible to load Environment variables first.

This makes it easy to bridge the gap and by having a standard way to convert environment variables into Java system properties make it possible to fully comply with [Twelve-factor App](https://12factor.net/config).

## Compile

You need to have the crystal compiler available in your classpath to succesfully build this utility, otherwise you can compile it statically using a docker image using `make buildStatic`.
